> Note about the "sf" R package:
  The sf dependency requires gdal-devel v > 2.0.0. This version, however, is
  not currently available for RHEL Client release 7.4 (Maipo) at SMHI/LINDA
  via simple "yum install". Two solutions are:
   (i) Get the needed RPMs/RPM sources for rgdal v2.x.x, as well as the needed
       dependencies, and rebuild/install them manually. This can be done at SMHI
       by using the "install_sys_deps.sh" script provided and passing the option
       "--enable_R_sf". 
  (ii) Do not install the sf R package at all. In this case, the current system
       dependencies can be installed at SMHI by running "install_sys_deps.sh".
       Although this is obviously not the ideal option, this carries only a 
       minimal risk of leading to failures in the future, as the "sf" package
       appears only as a "Suggests"-type pkg dependency of the "leaflet" R pkg.

  Option (ii) is the preferred one at SMHI, because option (i) updates the
  system "proj*", "libgeotiff*", "libspatialite*", "ogdi*" and "gdal*"packages,
  which leads to conflicts with other R-based software used locally (especially
  in the case of "proj*").
