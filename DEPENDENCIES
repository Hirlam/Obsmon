Installing the system dependencies proj-devel, proj-epsg and gdal-devel
 The sf dependency requires gdal-devel v > 2.0.0. This version, however, is not
 currently available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Client release 7.4 (Maipo) at
 SMHI via simple yum usage. The inslattation, therefore, needs some more work.
